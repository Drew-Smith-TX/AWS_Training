Ephimeral Storage: Block level Storage, temporary
Not recommended for critical or valuable data
If your instance is rebooted, data will remain intact

Usage:
    - no additional cost for Storage
    - very high I/O speed
    I3 instance family
        - possible 3.3 million random IOPS 
        - 1.4 million write IOPS 
    - Instance store volumes are ideal as a cache or buffer for rapidly changing data 
      without the need for retention
    - Often used within a load balancing group where data is replicated and pooled
      between the fleet
Instance store volumes
    - not available for all instances
    - size of the volume will increase as you increase the EC2 isntance size
    - store volumes have the same security as provided by EC2

Anti Patterns
    * Should not be used for
        - persistent data
        - data aceessed or sharded by multiple entities
