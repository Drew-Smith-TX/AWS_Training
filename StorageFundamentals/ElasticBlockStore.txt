EBS
    - Provides block level storage to EC2 instances
    - persistant and durable data storage
    - greater flexibilility than that of instance store volumes
    - EBS volumes can be attached to EC2 instances for raplidly changing data
    - used to retain valuable data due to persistant qualities
    - essential data is encrypted
    - independant of ec2 instances
    - EBS volumes act as network attached storage
    - each volume can only be attached to one ec2 instance
    - multiple EBS volumes can be attached to a single EC2 instance
EBS Snapshot offer point in time back ups as needed
    - manually invoke backup or schedule
    - incrementally updated
    - can recreate from existing Snapshot
    - possible to copy from one region to another
EBS Volume Types
    - SSD and HDD 
    - suited for work with smaller blocks
    - databases using transactional workloads
    - used for boot volumes often on EC2 instances
    - General Purpose SSD
        - provides single digit latency, 3000 IOPS
        - baseline of 3 iops - 10,000 iops
        - throughput of 128 mbs up to 170gb
        - increases to 160mb for 214 GB+ volumes
    - Provision IOPS
        - enhanced predictable performance 
        - specifi IOPS rate during new EBS Volume
        - Volumes attached to EBS optimized instances will deliver
          iops defined within 10%, 99% of time
        - range from 4-16tb
        - max iops 20000
    HDD
        - designed for high rate of throughput
        - processing big data
        - larger blocks of data
        - Cold HDD
            -lowest cost
            - large workloads accessed infrequently
            - high throughput capabilities
            - burst up to 80mbs per tb
            - max burst of 250mbs
            - delivers 99% of expected throughput
            - Cant use as a boot volume for instances
        - throughput optimized 
            - frequently accessed data
            - suited to work with large data sets
            - 250mbps
            - burst of 500mbps
            - not possible to boot
Encryption
    - offers encryption at rest and in transit.
    - managed by EBS itself
    - enabled by checkbox
    - used AES-256, interacts with AWS KMS
        - dek, cmk
Create New EBS Volume
    2 ways
        - during creation of EC2 instance
        - standalone EBS volume
changing the size of EBS Volume
    - elastically scalable
    - Increase the volume size via the AWS Mgmt Console or AWS capabilities
    - extend file system after increase 
    - possible to resize a volume by creating a new volume from a Snapshot
    - charges are billed on a per second basis and per router
EBS not well suited for all storage requirements
