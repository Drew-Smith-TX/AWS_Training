ECR Coponents
 1. Registry
    -allows you to store and host docker images and AMI in
    -https://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonawx.com
    -both read and write access
    -control via IAM policies
   
 2. Authorization Token
  **Communcate with docker client with default registry, on aws cli
        - aws ecr get-login --region region --no-include-email
        - docker login -u AWS -p password
        -will produce Authorization token to be used within 12 hrs
        https://aws_account_id.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
 3. Repository
    - objects within your registry that allow you to group together and secure 
      different docker images
    - multiple images can be created and categorized
    - You can assign policy permission to each Repository, push or pull
 4. Repository Policy
    - AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess
    - AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser
    - AMazonEC2ContainerRegistReadOnly
    Repository policies are resource based policies
        -you need to ensure you add a principal to the policy to determine who 
         has access and what permissions they have
        - for an AWS user to gain access to the registry, they will require access
          to the ecr:GetAuthorizationToken API call
 5. Image
    - Once you have configured your registry, repositories and security controls, and authenticated 
      your docker client with ECR, you can then begin storing your docker images in the required
      repositories
    - to push an image, use the docker push command
    - to pull, use docker pull command
