Lambda
    -Serverless computerr service that allows you to run your application
     without having to manage EC2 instances
    - no need to worry about provisioning, managing your own resource to run your
      code, managed by AWS 
    - AWS user does not neec to be concerned with what managing this compute power or where its provisioned from,
      its considered serverless 
    - Only pay for compute powere per 100ms of use 

4 steps in operation
    - upload code to lambda, write it within code editors lambda provides.  Node.js,
      Java, C#, Pyton, Go, Powershell, and RUBy
    - Configure Lambda to execute upon specific trigger from events, such as an s3 events
    - Lambda will run your code, using only the compute power as defined
    - AWS records the compute time in millisecond and the quantity of Lambda functions
      run to ascertain the cost of service
Components of AWS  Lambda
    Lambda Function - compiled of your own code that you want lambda to invoke
    Event Sources - AWS services that can be used to trigger lambda functions
    Trigger - an operation from an event sources that causes function to invoke
    Resources: resources that are required for the execution
    Log Streams: help to identify issues with function, essentially events recorded
                 in cloud watch
                
Creating Lambda functions
    - AWS Management Console    
        - Select A blueprint
        - s3 get object
    - Configure triggers, operation from event sources
    - Configure functions, resources, max execution timeout, IAM Role and handler
    - AWS lambda is highly scalable
