Computer Services can provide 100's of EC2 instances which may be used continuously

Can be consumed in different quantities, different times, offering
a wide scope of performance and benefit options

EC2 allows you to deploy virtual servers within your aws environments as a part of
solutions

EC2 components:
 - AMI Amazon machine images
 - instance types
 - instance purchasing options
 - tenancy
 - user data
 - storage options
 - security

 AMI
    - pre configured ec2 template which allow you to quickly launch a new EC2 instance
      witin the AMI
    - image baseline with an OS and apps with custom configs
    - Can create your own AMI images, install custom applications
    - once created, you can create new instance of that AMI, with custom apps installed
AWS Marketplace
    - preconfigured AMI instances created by vendors
Community AMI
    - created by AWS vendors
Instance types
    - EC2 provides a selection of instance optimized for use cases, that can run
      applicattions
    - varying combos of cpu, memory, storage, and networking capacity for applications
    - micro instances are good for low needs
General Purpose
    -provide a balance of computer, memory and network resources 
    -caching fleets, backend servers, microsoft share point, other entrerprise apps
Computer optimized
    - high performance front end, scientific and processing servers
GPU
    - used for GPU heavy operation
FPGA Instance
    - customized field programmable gate arrays
    - create application specific hardware acceleration, high cpu performance,
      large memory and high network bandwidth applications, parallel computing,
      data analytics, video processing, financial computing
Storage optimized
    - SSD storage options for application with specifi io and storage capacity reqs
    - low request latency
    - nvme
    - data warehouse or parallel file systems, nosql databases
Instance Purchasing options
    - On Demand
    - Reserved
    - Scheduled
    - Spot Instance
    - On Demand Capacity Reservations
On Demand
    - can be launched anytime
    - can used for as long as needed
    - flat rate on instance types
    - typically short time uses
    - best for testing and development environments
Resserved
    - Discounted for set perioud of time
    - must be purchased for 1 or 3 year time frame
    - Partial Upfront
    - no upfront, 
    best applied for long term predictable workloads
Scheduled instance
    - Reservations on a recurring schedule, daily, weekly, monthly
    - will still be charged if not use
Spot instances
    - bid for unused ec2 resources
    - no guarantees for fixed period of time
    - prices based on supply and Demand
    - 2 minute of warning before closing
    - processing data and applications that can be interuppted
On Demand Capacity
    - availabiltiy zone
    - used with reserved instance
tenancy
    : relates to what underlying host your EC2 instance will reside on, 
      physical server within an AWS Data Center
Shared tenancy
    - launched on any availabel host
    - same host used by multiple customers
    - AWS Security mechanisms prevent one EC2 instance accessing another in same host
Dedicated tenancy
    Dedicated Instances:
        - hosted on hardware no other customer has access to
        - May be required to meet compliance with Dedicated instances
        - incur additional charges
    Dedicated hosts:
        - additional visability and control on phsysical host
        - use same host for a number of instances
        - may be required to meet compliance
User Data:
    - enter command that will run during the first boot cycle
    - perform functions upon boot such as to pull down any aditional software
EC2 instance used will depend on usage
    - Persistent: 
        - avaible by attaching EBS volumes
        - logically attached via AWS network
        - like external hard disk
        - automatically allocated, data will remain intact if removed, encryption
          is available, bakcup snapshots
    - Ephimeral (temporary) known as instance back storage
        -physically attached to underlying host
        - all saved data on disk is lost if stopped or terminated
        - unable to detach instance store from volumes
    EC2 security
        - select a serurity group, define what traffic is allowed communication
        -instances are associated with security group
        -Create keypair to authenticate on instance
        - public key encrypts
        - private key decrypts data giving access
        - linux instances connect by ssh 
        - file must be kept 
        - your responsibilty to maintain latest security by OS vendor and software

How to setup
    -log into AWS Management Console
    - select EC2
    ** select Launch instance
        - choose AWS AMI
        - choose purpose 
        - Nex: configure instance
        - choose subnet
        - assig public ip 
        - assing role
        - assign shutdown behavior
        - select tenancy
    ** Configure security
    ** Launch
        - create key pair 
    ** System Checks
        - issue with underlying host
    ** instance status Checks
        - likely require your help to resolve
