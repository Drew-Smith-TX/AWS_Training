    - Web server environment
    - Worker environment

    - comprise of OS, language, server type, and components of Elastic Beanstalk 
      itself, and as a whole can be defined.
An application is a collection of different elements, such as environments, 
Configurations and application versions
Web server
    - typically used for standard web apps that operate and serve requests over http and port 8-0
    - route 53
    - elastic load balancing
    - auto Scaling
    - ec2 
    - security groups
Worker Environment
    - used by applications that will have a back end processing task
    - sqs
    - iam service role
    - auto Scaling
    -EC2
