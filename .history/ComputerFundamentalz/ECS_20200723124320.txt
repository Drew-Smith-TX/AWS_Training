              how many containers 
        - Monitoring is done by AWS Clous Watch
        - Clusters act as a resource pool, such as CPU and memory
        - Clusters are dynamically scalable and multiple instances are possible
        - only can scale within specific regions
        - can be deployed across cluster
        - also have docker demon and ecs agents
