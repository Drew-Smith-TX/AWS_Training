        on the same hardware
    - Reduced the amount of physical hardware required
    - cheaper costs to customer
Core services
    - replicated across diferent geographic zones and regions
SEcurity
    - considered to be more secure than your own data center
    - achieved by adhering to global compliance and industry standard by
