    Cloud Computing
    - is a remote virtual pool of on demand shared resources offering Compute,
      Storage, Database and network services that can be rapidly deployed at 
      scale.
    Virtualization
    - allows the possibliltiy of having multiple VM running on the same server
      at one time
    Hypervisor
    - Software used to create virutualized environment allowing for multiple
      VM's to be installed on the same host.
    - Sits between the physical hardware and the virtual machines and creates
      a shared pool of virtual hardware resources for each of the to access
    - any request to the hardware goes via the Hypervisor which handles access,
      ensuring the hardware resources are shared between other VMs as needed.
    Benefits of virutualization
    - Reduced capital expenditure, less hardware is needed as you have ability to 
      provision multiple VMs on one host
    - Reduced operating cost, less hardware less space, power, and cooling
    - Smaller Footprint: less space
    - Optimization of resources: In a cloud environment everyone can benefit 
      from virutualization, vendor to consumer

    Understanding virutualization
        - a vm in the cloud is referred to as an instance
    Compute objects
        - provid the brains to process
    Storage 
        - allows you to save data, harddrive, Network Attached Storage, NAS, or 
          SAN Storage Area Network
    Database 
        -allow you to store structured sets of data used by applications
    Network resources
        -provide connectivity to communicate with eachother
        -firewalls to allow or deny access
